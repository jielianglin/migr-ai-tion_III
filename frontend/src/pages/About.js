                The liminal character of migration experiences is our departure from the quantifying influences of computer vision upon visual culture, and our modes of perception and being.
                Not only do we want to counter the hegemonic media narratives about migration and (post)colonial societies, but
                we also want to develop new models for building knowledge, participation and interconnectivity.
                For our team, this means going beyond superficial tropes of “diversity”, and delving deeper into inquiries of what knowledge is,
                how it is created and who it serves. Our dream is to provide those who are underrepresented, a voice in the future media landscape.

                such as Stan Brackhage. </div>
